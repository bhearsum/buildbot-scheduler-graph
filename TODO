* Make root-only graphs optional (alternative behaviour is all in one)
* Make graph merging actually work
* Add ChangeSources?
* Map sendchange -> Schedulers (maybe need another dict like triggerables?)
** Can probably be done through ChangeSources, as long as one SendChange cs is added for every root Scheduler with a unique branch.
* Make it possible to process multiple configs
* Other output formats (.dot and/or other parseable formats)
* Make sure it works with Python 3
