* Make root-only graphs optional (alternative behaviour is all in one)
* Make graph merging actually work
* Add ChangeSources?
* Map sendchange -> Schedulers (maybe need another dict like triggerables?)
* Implement builder merging (eg, "foo 1/2" and "foo 1/2" become "foo")
** Probably needs to be overridable with a custom method.
